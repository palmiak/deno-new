## Dependency Management

During the deployment process, Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `package.json` file.

## Web Server Setup

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application.

### Start Command

When deploying an application Kinsta will automatically create a web process with `npm start` as the entry point. Make sure to use this command to run your server.

## Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit) the `npm build` command is run, followed by the `npm start` command.

## What is Deno
**Deno** is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults and a great developer experience.

### Key Features
- **TypeScript out of the box:** First-class support for TypeScript – no need to spend hours configuring things that break as soon as you update a dependency.
- **Great all-in-one tooling:** Built-in linter, code formatter, ability to build a self-contained executable, test runner, IDE integration, and more.
